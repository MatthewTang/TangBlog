# Testing Made Easy

Struggling with database bugs? I'll share how I built the OceanBase tool with Python and SQL, spotting 12 sneaky issues and cutting testing time by 30%.

## The Problem

Database testing was taking too long and missing critical bugs. We needed a better approach.

## The Solution

Built a comprehensive testing tool with:

- **Automated Test Generation**: Generate test cases from schema
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity across operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track query performance
- **Bug Detection**: Identify edge cases and race conditions

## Results

- Found 12 critical bugs that would have made it to production
- Reduced testing time by 30%
- Improved team confidence in releases

Simple tips to make your testing smoother and smarter.
