# Mobile App Tricks

Want snappier mobile apps? Drawing from AssetBozz, I'll cover React Native hacks that boosted retention by 15%, like optimizing load times and user flows.

## Performance Optimization

Here are some key strategies I've learned:

- **Lazy Loading**: Only load components when needed
- **Image Optimization**: Use proper image formats and compression
- **Bundle Splitting**: Reduce initial load times
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of listeners and timers

## User Flow Improvements

The key to retention is smooth user experience:

1. Minimize friction in onboarding
2. Provide clear visual feedback
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use meaningful animations

These simple tweaks can make a huge difference in user satisfaction and retention.
